=head1 NAME

NSS - Perl bindings to NSS (Netscape Security Services)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Using NSS for SSL connections from LWP
  use LWP;
  use NSS config_dir => "$ENV{HOME}/.netscape";
  use Net::HTTPS;
  
  local $Net::HTTPS::SSL_SOCKET_CLASS = "Net::NSS::SSL";
  
  my $content = get("https://secure.mycompany.com");
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an interface to Netscape Security Services (NSS) which is a set of libraries 
that Firefox, Thunderbird and several other applications uses for crypto, secure sockets, 
signing mail etc. NSS provides support for SSL v2 and v3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12, S/MIME, 
X.509 v3 certificates, and other security standards.

Currently this module only implements the SSL bits but in the future (patches welcome!!) most of NSS will 
be available via this module.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 MODULE IMPORT

During import no initalization is normally done. It's however possible to do this by passing either 
C<config_dir =E<gt> PATH> or C<init>. If the later, import checks for the environment C<NSS_CONFIG_DIR> 
and sets the config dir to that if set.

=head2 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item config_dir ( ) : STRING

Returns the path where to look for C<cert8.db>, C<key3.db> and C<secmod.db> databases upon initialization.

=item set_config_dir ( DIRECTORY ) : BOOL

Specify the path to the directory where the C<cert8.db>, C<key3.db> and C<secmod.db> databases can be found. 
It's only allowed to set the directory prior to initialization or this method with return a false value.

=item is_initialized ( ) : BOOL

Returns whether the underlying NSS library has been initialized or not.

=item initialize ( ) : ERROR_CODE

Initializes NSS. Returns 0 on success or an error code on failure. Initialization is usually done 
when importing this module by passing either C<config_dir =E<gt> $path> or C<init> to use 
the default config directory (C<.>).
